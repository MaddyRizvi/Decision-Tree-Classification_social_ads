# Decision Tree Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset

This project demonstrates how to apply the **Decision Tree Classification** algorithm on the Social Network Ads dataset using Python and scikit-learn. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and visualization of decision boundaries for both training and test sets.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, which contains information such as:

- Age
- Estimated Salary
- Purchased (Target variable)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing (splitting and scaling)
- Model training using Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy score
- Visualization of decision boundaries for both training and test sets

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

The Decision Tree Classifier is trained using the 'entropy' criterion (information gain).

## 📊 Results

Visualizations include clear decision boundaries on:

The confusion matrix and accuracy score are printed to evaluate the model.
